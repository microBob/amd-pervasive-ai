Müller-Lyer Illusion
----------------------
This experiment is based on an optical illusion devised by Franz Carl Müller-Lyer in 1889. In this illusion, the perceived length of a line depends on the arrowheads on both its sides. If the tip of the arrowheads are facing towards the line (">---<"), the line is usually perceived as longer than the line whose tip is facing away from its line ("<--->").

In this task, participants are required to judge which line is longer than the other. 


Experimental conditions
-----------------------
There are 2 experimental conditions (same and different). In the same condition, both lines are the same length. In the different condition, one of the lines is longer than the other. "line1" refers to the line with the tip of the arrows facing towards the line (">---<") while "line2" refers to the line with the tip of the arrow facing away from the line ("<--->").

The positions of these lines are also randomised on either the left or right of the screen. To change the length of the lines, you can change the numbers under length_line1 and length_line2 columns in the conditions excel file. Remember to adjust the corrAns column respectively. 

Since this task can be used locally or online (including touchscreen devices), there are several corrAns column. If response is made via keyboard, the column is called corrAnsKeyboard. If response is made via mouse, the columns are corrAnsLine, corrAnsLeftArrow and corrAnsRightArrow. This is to take into account the different areas of the stimuli participants may press/click when responding.

Analysing your data
-------------------
Data is stored in the excel file produced by PsychoPy in the data folder. The accuracy and reaction times data for both keyboard and mouse response can be found in response and reactionTimes columns within the excel file respectively. There is a column named condition. This can help with separating the data. 

For the same condition, the correct answer is coded for the line with the tip of the arrows pointing towards the line. Therefore, if response is 1, this means that participants perceived that this line is longer than the other line indicating the Müller-Lyer illusion is successful.

For the different condition, the correct answer is coded for the line whose numerical value for the width is largest. 1 represents correct response and 0 reperesents incorrect response.
