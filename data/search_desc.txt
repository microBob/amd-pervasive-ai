Information for researcher
==========================
This is a simple visual search task where there's an X amount of L's as distractors and participants are expected to click on the T when they find it. The distractors are created using a code component instead of creating multiple text components which may be inefficient if the researcher would like to have 100 distractors on screen.

Data analysis
=============
The time taken to find the target, "T", can be found in the column "mouse.time".

Extra
====
To manipulate orientation of distractors, an image component can be used instead of a text component.
