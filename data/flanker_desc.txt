A version of the Eriksen flanker task (Eriksen & Eriksen, 1974) was adapted from the Attention Network Test (ANT; e.g., Rueda et al., 2004; Fan, McCandliss, Sommer, Raz, & Posner, 2002). In a flanker task, participants are required to indicate the leftâ€“right orientation of a centrally presented stimulus while inhibiting attention to the potentially incongruent stimuli that surround it (i.e., the flankers, typically two on either side). In the traditional flanker task, the stimuli are arrows pointing left or right, whereas in the ANT version used with children, the stimuli are fish (designed to be more engaging and also larger, which makes the task easier). The version created for the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery includes both an easier fish block and a more difficult arrows block. On some trials, the orientation of the flanking stimuli is congruent with the orientation of the central stimulus, and on others it is incongruent. Performance on the incongruent trials provides a measure of inhibitory control in the context of visual selective attention (which can also be considered a measure of executive attention; e.g., Fan et al., 2002), and shows clinical utility in identifying deficits associated with neurological disorder (e.g., Coubard et al., 2011).
