Word Superiority Effect
========================

*Key words: Language, Words, Word Superiority Effect, Reicher*

Description
-------------

This task is created based on Reicher (1969) to demonstrate the Word Superiority Effect - where response times and accuracy will be faster and more accurate to identify letters embedded in words compared with non-words. This is an adapted paradigm, for full task details see references.

Stimuli
--------
4 letter words selected because one letter in that word can be changed to form a new word e.g. WORK can be changed to WORD by substituting the 4th letter. 

It is equally as likely a letter will or won't be in a word. 
There is an equal number of words and non-words.
Letter substitutions occur at each place in a word with equal probability (i.e. it is equally as likely the first letter or the last letter will be the critical letter)

Hypotheses
-------------

Response times should be longer, and accuracy lower for non words compared with words.

Data Output
-------------

* `word_average_acc` - average accuracy for words
* `nonword_average_acc` - average accuracy for nonwords
* `word_average_rt` - average response time for words
* `nonword_average_rt` - average response time for nonwords
* `correct` - correct = 1, incorrect = 0
* `rt` - response time in seconds
* `condition` - word or nonword
* `letter_position` - the position of the letter in the word to be identified.
* `this_word` - word presented
