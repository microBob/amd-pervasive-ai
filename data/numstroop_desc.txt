Numerical Stroop - measuring reaction times to incongruent stimuli
==================================================================



The experiment
--------------------

The numerical Stroop (Henik and Tzelgov, 1982) is a variant of the classic Stroop task (Stroop, 1935).

In the numerical Stroop, participants must select the greater number in semantic trials, 
while ignoring the actual size of the numbers and in the physical trials they have to choose
the physically larger number, while ignoring the actual value of the numbers.

Data Analysis
--------------------


Data can be found in the data folder next to where the
 experiment was saved. 
After analysing the mean reaction time for congruent and incongruent physical and semantic trials,
typically, the 
incongruent conditions will have larger reactions times.



Notes
--------------------


This is a close replication of Henik and Tzelgov (1982), however letter height is larger.
