Notes for researchers
=====================
This is a basic Iowa gambing task based on this [paper](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=7c477b1f3fdb66e5dfd3cf3dffa0dada505dba3e) by Bechara et al. (1994).

The cards used in this task can be found in the assests folder. To make modifications to the cards, you can edit in ```asset_creation.pptx``` and save/replace the cards in the assets folder.

The trials has a 50% probability of being a penalty trial and the pink and purple cards are the high rewards/risks cards while the teal and gold are the low rewards/risks cards. You can change the probabilities in the spreadsheet - ```cond_file.xlsx```.


Data
====
You can find the amount of times a card is clicked in columns:
- ```n_gold_clicks```
- ```n_pink_clicks```
- ```n_teal_clicks```
- ```n_purple_clicks```

You can find the reaction times in the column - ```mouse.time```
