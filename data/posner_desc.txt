Posner Cueing Paradigm (Posner, 1980)
-------------------------------------

The Posner cueing paradigm is a neuropsychological test used to assess attention.
Specifically, the task will measure the effects of covert attention, when you attend
to a particular location on the screen without moving your eyes to it. 

In this task, the participant must respond as quickly as possible to the presentation of a
stimulus (we'll use a simple filled circle) that appears on the left or right of the screen.
Before the target is presented we show a cue (a triangle) that points to the left or the right.
Most of the time the cue will point to the correct location so you attention will naturally
shift to that location, in expectation of seeing the target appear there. On occassional trials,
however, the cue will point to the incorrect location; the target will appear on the wrong side
and the participant will not benefit from the advantage of having attention there.

We measure the effect of attention by looking at the speed of response time to the target.
In general, participants respond faster to targets following spatially congruent cues than
spatially incongruent cues (Posner, 1980).

Analysis
--------

This task can record RTs on a keyboard and mouse. The reaction times for keyboard can be found in the column keyPress.rt and the reaction times for mouse can be found in mouse.time.
