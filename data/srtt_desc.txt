The Simple Reaction Time Task (Deary & Liewald, 2011)
======================================================

Reaction times have been studies for over 100 years and a staple of scientific study in psychology. A commonly used procedure is to study reaction time involves measuring simple reaction times to a single stimulus.

The task
--------------

The simple reaction time task (Deary & Liewald, 2011) is a computer-based task implemented in PsychoPy in which participants must respond as quickly as possible in response to a single stimulus.

Extensions
--------------

Deary and Liewald (2011) also developed a choice reaction time task which complicates the simple reaction time task by requiring participants to respond to one of a number of stimuli. See if you can modify this task to allow multiple choice responses to be made to stimuli that can appear in one of multiple locations on screen.
