Corsi blocks task
----------------------

Really basic version of the Corsi blocks task in PsychoPy.

The participant must click the squares with the mouse in the same sequence that they had flashed red.

To make it slightly easier to track which squares are already pressed, and to acknowledge the click, they remain red after a click. When all squares are clicked, participants can submit their responses via the Submit button that appears after the amount of blocks clicked is equal to the amount of blocks that flashed red.

The number of lit squares will increase if they were correct in the previous trial.


**Issue where squares can overlap** - This is now fixed as of 15th June 2023.
